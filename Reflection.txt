What is the most challenging thing you experienced?
 - One challenging aspect of this program could be error handling and input validation.
   Ensuring that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully and provides informative
   error messages can be crucial for a user-friendly experience and to prevent unexpected behavior.
How did you overcome it?
 - I had to implement robust error handling and input validation mechanisms in your program
Anything you would do differently given what you know now.
 - I would use more classes to make it easier to manage and to find.
Was it helpful to build on a project that you already built in lab?
 - Yes, it makes it easier to memorize the code and understand it more.
Are you becoming more comfortable with classes?
 - Yes, I have been more comfortable and understanding to use classes. It helped me memorize
    the codes when we use them more.
How did you feel about arrays? Were there things about them that you would like to overcome?
 - I am understanding what an array is and how it is used. I have re-learn it myself to be comfortable
    with it, but it is still progress. I want to overcome it now by learning ways to memorize the code.
